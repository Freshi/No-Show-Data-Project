# Investigate a Dataset | No Show Appintments



## Dataset

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. The data set can be found [here]('This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

Before analysing the data, I did some preliminary wrangling where I renamed to shorten them for ease of use and also correct mispelled ones. I also changed the dtype of some of the variables to their appropriate types.



## Summary of Findings

From the EDA conducted, we were able to see that more women make medical appointments as compared to men. However, the proportions of no shows for both genders is almost the same. We also noted that more minors, seniors and old people show up for their appointments as compared to adults and centenerians. We also see that sending an sms does not guarantee people will show up. On the other hand, people with a scholarship, hypertension and, or diabetes tend to show up more for their appointment in contrast to alcoholics and those with a handicap. We can also see that some hospital locations have more no shows than others.

 > Further analysis of the data needs to be done to esstablish deeper relationships within the variables. We have not yet established what variables are more likely to contribute to less no shows and further statistical methods have to be applied to establish this.

## Futher Information

The original dataset can be found on [Kaggle]('https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments'). ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program [Bolsa Família]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia').# No-Show-Analysis
